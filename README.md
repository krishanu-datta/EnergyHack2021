## Challenge
At MIT's EnergyHack 2021, our team was assigned Edison Energy's challenge to create environmental and social impact for utility-scale renewable energy projects. Edison Energy is a energy-related consulting firm that helps their clients meet their ESG goals and deliver sustainable and socially-progressive solutions. We sought out to help them with their mission.

## Results
One part of helping Edison Energy in their quest was drumming up potential multi-faceted solutions that could both be dynamically and at a utility-scale. One such solution we came up with was for business's to target low-Income communities and offer entry-level employment opportunities within their company (with promise of upward mobility) in exchange for solar panel installation incentives. This idea would show a company's commitment to solar and renewable energy projects, while simulatenously addressing income inequality within our nation's employment and society. On top of this, the sustainability sector as a whole is dominated by white males and is often underrepresented across all levels. 

### We chose to use dig deeper into this solution by building a tool that identified areas with high unemployment and also portrayed the communities that would stand to gain the most from solar panel development by decreasing the most amount of CO2 emissions.
We used an EPA tool, AVERT, to produce the emission reduction data and found the employment data on the BLS website. We cleaned the data in the Jupyter Notebook above and then constructed the tool in Tableau.
